\letteraddress{Dear Comrade Warde,}

You are one of the comparatively few comrades who are seriously interested in the methodological questions of our movement. Don’t you believe that your intervention in the discussion from \emph{this} point of view would be very useful?

Friends write me that the interest for dialectical materialism in our party, especially in the youth, is becoming very acute. Don’t you believe that comrades who could orientate this interest should now create some purely theoretical association with the purpose of promoting in the party the doctrines of dialectical materialism. Yourself, Comrade Wright, Comrade Gerland (very well acquainted with the matter) could possibly form the nucleus of such an association, of course, under the control of the propaganda department of the National Committee. It is, certainly, only a vague suggestion from afar which should be discussed with the responsible party institutions.
